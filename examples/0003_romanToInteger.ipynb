        "* Then, you want to loop your string while chekcing the difference between ajacent character. If the left charater is bigger than the right character, you will add the value of left charater to your sum. However, if the left charater is smaller than the right character, you would like to deduct your sum by the value of the left charater. And you will do this check process for $(n-1)$ nuumber of times, where $n$ is the length of the input string.\n",
